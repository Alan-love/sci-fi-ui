## Why is Sci-Fi UI being open-sourced?

After years on the AssetStore, we're open-sourcing Sci-fi UI Design for uGUI because we're moving on to new projects and tools. You can read more in our blog post.

100% in the hands of the community, we hope to see the tool flourish, development continue, and any upcoming bugs fixed (the tool should be bug-free as-is).

## What's included with Sci-fi UI Design for uGUI?

#### Screen Space (VR-Ready)

(Almost) all elements can be tweaked directly inside the Unity UI editor. Change colors, animations and layouts directly from the inspector!

#### Animations
The Sci-Fi UI Design comes with many build-in animations that can naturally be tweaked with ease.

#### Menu and HUD Elements
With a complete main menu demo that you can customize or re-build from scratch, you will quickly get an idea of what the Sci-Fi UI Design can do. 

Additionally, a lot of components were designed to make the design as versatile as possible. All designs are in the package in .AI format.

#### Many Use-cases
The Sci-Fi UI design was made with many different game types in mind. It can be used for RPG, Flying, FPS, Survival game types and more!

#### Stunning Animations
The Sci-Fi UI Design comes with many stunning animations, ready to be used directly in your games.

Inlcuded is also a production ready HUD for flying, FPS, Survival and RPG games!

#### Demo Game Included
Included in the Sci-Fi UI is a demo of a flying game, showcasing just one way that the asset can be used.

The adjustable layouts, animations and various HUD elements means that the asset can also be used for more traditional RPG and space Survival Games, however.
